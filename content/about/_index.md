title: "About me"
---

I am a tenured CNRS researcher since 2025, and I am currently working in the Spatial Regulation of Genomes laboratory under Romain Koszul, at the Institut Pasteur / CNRS UMR 3525 in Paris. I joined the Institut Pasteur as a postdoc in 2020, bringing with me an in-depth expertise in bioinformatics and computational biology.  

Prior to joining Institut Pasteur, I earned my PhD in Genetics from the University of Cambridge, studying under Julie Ahringer. While there, I conducted research on tissue-specific and developmentally-regulated gene expression in *Caenorhabditis elegans*. Before pursuing my Ph.D., I earned my Master's degree in Genetics the École Normale Supérieure de Cachan in 2016, and was a visiting researcher in the Plath laboratory at UCLA in 2015, where I focused on the molecular mechanisms underpinning chromosome-wide gene silencing by *Xist* long non-coding RNA.  

Currently, I am working on developing groundbreaking methodologies to model dynamics of multi-modal chromatin organization and its impact on gene regulation across biological systems. I have contributed to developing data structures and tools for genome-wide omics data, including **momics** for deep-learning applications, the **tidyomics** ecosystem and the **HiCExperiment** suite of R packages. I come from an experimental biology background, transitioned toward combined "wet/dry" research during my Ph.D., and eventually focused entirely on computational data analysis during my postdoctoral work.  

Previously, I have worked on:

- Facilitating use of multi-omics data for deep-learning applications;
- Decrypting principles of 3D genome organization in microeukaryotes;
- Modeling cell cycle-like transcriptional dynamics during mouse cell differentiation;
- Profiling tissue-specific regulatory landscape in *C. elegans*.

For a full record of my publications, see [Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=jacques+serizay%5BAuthor%5D&sort=pubdate).

I develop computational frameworks for analyzing cutting-edge biological data. I maintain over a dozen python and R packages, published either on Pypi or Bioconductor. In 2024, I was elected as a member of the Bioconductor Technical Advisory Board for a three-year term, contributing to the strategic direction of the project.

If you are working in a company and would like help with some analysis or one of my packages, don’t hesitate to get in touch, as I am happy to consult on projects.
