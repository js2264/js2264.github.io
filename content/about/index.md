I am a tenured CNRS researcher since 2025, and I am currently working in the Spatial Regulation of Genomes laboratory under Romain Koszul, at the Institut Pasteur / CNRS UMR 3525 in Paris. I joined the Institut Pasteur as a postdoc in 2020, bringing with me an in-depth expertise in bioinformatics and computational biology. 
Prior to joining Institut Pasteur, I earned my PhD in Genetics from the University of Cambridge, studying under Julie Ahringer. While there, I conducted research on tissue-specific and developmentally-regulated gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans. Before pursuing my Ph.D., I earned my Master's degree in Genetics the Ecole Normale Superieure in 2016, and was a visiting researcher in the Plath laboratory at UCLA in 2015, where I focused on the molecular mechanisms underpinning chromosome-wide gene silencing by Xist long non-coding RNA. 

I focus on the integration and analysis of large multi-omics datasets across prokaryotic, microeukaryotic and metazoan systems, to study multi-modal chromatin organization and its impact on gene regulation. I have contributed to developing data structures and tools for genome-wide chromatin conformation capture analysis, including the HiCExperiment suite of R packages. I come from an experimental biology background, transitioned toward combined "wet/dry" research during my Ph.D., generating high-throughput sequencing libraries while analyzing the resulting datasets, eventually focusing entirely on computational data analysis during my postdoctoral work.
