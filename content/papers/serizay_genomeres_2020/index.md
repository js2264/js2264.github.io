##### Abstract

RNA profiling has provided increasingly detailed knowledge of gene expression patterns, yet the different regulatory ar-
chitectures that drive them are not well understood. To address this, we profiled and compared transcriptional and regu-
latory element activities across five tissues of Caenorhabditis elegans, covering ∼90% of cells. We find that the majority of
promoters and enhancers have tissue-specific accessibility, and we discover regulatory grammars associated with ubiquitous,
germline, and somatic tissue–specific gene expression patterns. In addition, we find that germline-active and soma-specific
promoters have distinct features. Germline-active promoters have well-positioned +1 and −1 nucleosomes associated with a
periodic 10-bp WW signal (W = A/T). Somatic tissue–specific promoters lack positioned nucleosomes and this signal, have
wide nucleosome-depleted regions, and are more enriched for core promoter elements, which largely differ between tissues.
We observe the 10-bp periodic WW signal at ubiquitous promoters in other animals, suggesting it is an ancient conserved
signal. Our results show fundamental differences in regulatory architectures of germline and somatic tissue–specific genes,
uncover regulatory rules for generating diverse gene expression patterns, and provide a tissue-specific resource for
future studies.
