##### Abstract

Phages are diverse and abundant within microbial communities, where 
they play major roles in their evolution and adaptation. Phage replication, 
and multiplication, is generally thought to be restricted within a single 
or narrow host range. Here we use published and newly generated 
proximity-ligation-based metagenomic Hi-C (metaHiC) data from various 
environments to explore virus–host interactions. We reconstructed 4,975 
microbial and 6,572 phage genomes of medium quality or higher. MetaHiC 
yielded a contact network between genomes and enabled assignment 
of approximately half of phage genomes to their hosts, revealing that a 
substantial proportion of these phages interact with multiple species in 
environments as diverse as the oceanic water column or the human gut. 
This observation challenges the traditional view of a narrow host spectrum 
of phages by unveiling that multihost associations are common across 
ecosystems, with implications for how they might impact ecology and 
evolution and phage therapy approaches.
