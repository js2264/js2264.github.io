##### Abstract

The growth of omic data presents evolving challenges in data manipulation, 
analysis and integration. Addressing these challenges, Bioconductor 
provides an extensive community-driven biological data analysis 
platform. Meanwhile, tidy R programming offers a revolutionary data 
organization and manipulation standard. Here we present the tidyomics 
software ecosystem, bridging Bioconductor to the tidy R paradigm. This 
ecosystem aims to streamline omic analysis, ease learning and encourage 
cross-disciplinary collaborations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 
tidyomics by analyzing 7.5 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 
the Human Cell Atlas, spanning six data frameworks and ten analysis tools.
