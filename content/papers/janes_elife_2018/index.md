##### Abstract

An essential step for understanding the transcriptional circuits that control
development and physiology is the global identification and characterization of regulatory
elements. Here, we present the first map of regulatory elements across the development and
ageing of an animal, identifying 42,245 elements accessible in at least one Caenorhabditis elegans
stage. Based on nuclear transcription profiles, we define 15,714 protein-coding promoters and
19,231 putative enhancers, and find that both types of element can drive orientation-independent
transcription. Additionally, more than 1000 promoters produce transcripts antisense to protein
coding genes, suggesting involvement in a widespread regulatory mechanism. We find that the
accessibility of most elements changes during development and/or ageing and that patterns of
accessibility change are linked to specific developmental or physiological processes. The map and
characterization of regulatory elements across C. elegans life provides a platform for
understanding how transcription controls development and ageing.
