##### Abstract

The composition of genomic
sequences, such as GC content, nucleotide
motifs, and repeats, varies from one species to
another and within the same genome. Composition correlates with gene transcriptional
activity and chromosome organization, and all
genome sequences have coevolved with the
chromatin-associated complexes they encode
to precisely regulate these two features. However, when foreign DNA—including exogenous
mobile elements and natural or artificial genesinvades or integrates a host nucleus, it encounters regulatory mechanisms and rules
under which it has not evolved. How host cells
process and eventually adopt these unfamiliar exogenous sequences remains largely unexplored.
