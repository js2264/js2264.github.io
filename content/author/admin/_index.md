I am currently doing a PhD at the University of Cambridge, in Julie Ahringer lab.  

My main project aims to shed some light on the tissue-specific mechanisms of gene regulation used during embryonic and post-embryonic development. I come from an experimental biology background, but I quickly moved toward a "wet/dry" PhD (*i.e.* generating high-throughput sequencing libraries during the day, and analysing the resulting datasets at night). To answer fundamental biological questions, I use R to dig into the data I generated to highlight biological mechanisms in development.  

On my spare time, I am an ardent moviegoer. I wrote an R package to analyse movie box-office results ([link here](https://github.com/js2264/moviestats)), and I am now moving to Python to build an interactive dashboard to visually investigate the trends in movie industry by year, genre and actor. But I can still enjoy a movie without thinking about numbers: [check out my Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/jserizay/).
