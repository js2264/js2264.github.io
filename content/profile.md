I am a tenured CNRS researcher currently working in the **Spatial Regulation of Genomes** laboratory under Romain Koszul at the **Institut Pasteur / CNRS UMR 3525** in Paris, which I joined as a postdoc in 2020, after finishing my PhD in Genetics with Pr. **Julie Ahringer at the University of Cambridge**.

<br>

Before that, I obtained my Master's degree in Genetics from the **École Normale Supérieure de Cachan** in 2016, and was a visiting researcher in the **Plath laboratory at UCLA** in 2015.

When not diving deep into genomic data 🧬, I prefer to dive deep 🤿, *literally*. The sequence in the background is the cDNA of the longest isoform of *erbb3b*, a gene identified in *Amphiprion clarkii* ({{< fish image="Aclarkii.png" >}}Nemo's darker cousin, look at it!{{< /fish >}}) that plays a key role in its pigmentation patterns (see [Moore et al., G3 2022 for more](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9997566/#jkad002-s2)).
