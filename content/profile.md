I am a tenured CNRS researcher working **at the Institut Pasteur, Dept. Genomes & Genetics**, in Paris. My long-term endeavor is to decrypt the intricate, multi-modal organization of genomes and its impact on gene regulation. To achieve this, I develop computational frameworks for analyzing cutting-edge biological data. 

<br>

Between 2020 and 2025, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the **Spatial Regulation of Genomes laboratory** under Pr. **Romain Koszul**, focusing on chromatin organization and genome dynamics in microeukaryotes. Before that, I completed my PhD in Genetics with Pr. **Julie Ahringer at the University of Cambridge**. I obtained my Master's degree in Genetics from the **École Normale Supérieure de Cachan** in 2016, and was a visiting researcher in the **Plath laboratory at UCLA** in 2015.

When not diving deep into genomic data 🧬, I prefer to dive deep 🤿, *literally*. The sequence in the background is the cDNA of the longest isoform of *erbb3b*, a gene identified in *Amphiprion clarkii* ({{< fish image="Aclarkii.png" >}}Nemo's darker cousin, look at it!{{< /fish >}}) that plays a key role in its pigmentation patterns (see [Moore et al., G3 2022 for more](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9997566/#jkad002-s2)).
