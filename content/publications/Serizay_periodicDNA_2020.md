# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "Periodic occurrences of oligonucleotide sequences can impact the physical properties of DNA. For example, DNA bendability is modulated by 10-bp periodic occurrences of WW (W = A/T) dinucleotides. We present periodicDNA, an R package to identify k-mer periodicity and generate continuous tracks of k-mer periodicity over genomic loci of interest, such as regulatory elements. periodicDNA will facilitate investigation and improve understanding of how periodic DNA sequence features impact function."
