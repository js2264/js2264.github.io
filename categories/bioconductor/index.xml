      <description>I know I am probably being over-enthousiastic about it, but I keep learning about ggplot2 features and I can’t get enough of it. Lately, I have discovered the possibilities of animating ggplots based on aesthetics of interest, and as usual, this is as simple as a single line of code…&#xA;In this post, I will rely on some single-cell RNA-seq data (from a 10X Genomics sequencing run) containing gene expression for ~500 mouse cycling Radial Glial Progenitors (RGPs).</description>

      <description>I love Bioconductor Since its early ages, Bioconductor has gone very far. I’ve been on board for the past 7-ish years (I think), I use it every day, and every day, I think about how much I love it.&#xA;Some reasons… I love Bioconductor for many reasons, some of them being GenomicRanges, SummarizedExperiment, DESeq2, and of course the amazing team.&#xA;But today, one reason which I want to discuss in more depth is the Annotation Hub.</description>
