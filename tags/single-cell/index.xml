      <description>I know I am probably being over-enthousiastic about it, but I keep learning about ggplot2 features and I can’t get enough of it. Lately, I have discovered the possibilities of animating ggplots based on aesthetics of interest, and as usual, this is as simple as a single line of code…&#xA;In this post, I will rely on some single-cell RNA-seq data (from a 10X Genomics sequencing run) containing gene expression for ~500 mouse cycling Radial Glial Progenitors (RGPs).</description>
